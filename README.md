# R-notebook-templates
This repository contains notebook templates for submission to US-RSE hosted calls for submissions, two broad types of submissions are represented 1) reproducible documents which are defined to be artifacts that are executed sequentially from beginning to end and do not require input or interaction from the user and 2) Interactive Notebooks which are defined by being dependent on, and specifically designed for user input and interaction. For R users, we expect the formats for reproducible documents to be Quarto documents or R Markdown documents and for interactive notebooks to be a shiny app. Templates for Quarto documents and Shiny apps may be found in this repository. Templates for python-language submissions may be found at [https://github.com/USRSE/jupyter-notebook-templates](https://github.com/USRSE/jupyter-notebook-templates). *Submitters are not limited to these formats, but must make sure their submission adheres to the submission requirements.* Submitters who feel their work does not fall into either category of reproducible documents or interactive notebooks may choose to submit to a third category called "Innovative Uses of Notebooks" with a justification of why it does not belong in the first two categories and why it should be considered as a "new" submission format.
