## Quarto Markdown

R Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Quarto is a multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, and includes dozens of new features and capabilities while at the same being able to render most existing Rmd files without modification. Learn more about [Quarto for R Markdown users](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html).
